The newspaper's first building was located at 113 Nassau Street in New York City. In 1854, it moved to 138 Nassau
Street, and in 1858 to 41 Park Row, making it the first newspaper in New York City housed in a building built
specifically for its use.

The newspaper moved its headquarters to the Times Tower, located at 1475 Broadway in 1904,in an area then called
Longacre Square, that was later renamed Times Square in the newspaper's honor.The top of the building—now known
as One Times Square—is the site of the New Year's Eve tradition of lowering a lighted ball, which was begun by the
paper. The building is also known for its electronic news ticker—popularly known as "The Zipper"—where headlines
crawl around the outside of the building. It is still in use, but has been operated by Dow Jones & Company since
1995. After nine years in its Times Square tower, the newspaper had an annex built at 229 West 43rd Street.
After several expansions, the 43rd Street building became the newspaper's main headquarters in 1960 and the Times Tower
on Broadway was sold the following year. It served as the newspaper's main printing plant until 1997, when the
newspaper opened a state-of-the-art printing plant in the College Point section of Queens.

A decade later, The New York Times moved its newsroom and businesses headquarters from West 43rd Street to a new tower
at 620 Eighth Avenue between West 40th and 41st Streets, in Manhattan, directly across Eighth Avenue from the Port
Authority Bus Terminal. The new headquarters for the newspaper, known officially as The New York Times Building but
unofficially called the new "Times Tower" by many New Yorkers, is a skyscraper designed by Renzo Piano.
